## How to Build the Project
> **_Note:_**  The commands <i>must</i> be run in order. Each step sequentially needs the previous to have run to completion. I have also created a video guide walkthrough that goes through the build steps and testing steps that helps you navigate this in an intuitve way.

## Troubleshooting
If you are encountering trouble, check to make sure your build is removed, and the config files have been removed before re-trying the build steps. 

A helper script is available to you to accomplish this, by running the below in a terminal.

    npm run clean
